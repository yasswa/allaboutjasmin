	<p>Jasmines are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Eurasia, Australasia and Oceania, although only one of the 200 species is native to Europe.Their center of diversity is in South Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

	<p>A number of jasmine species have become naturalized in Mediterranean Europe. For example, the so-called Spanish jasmine (<i class="taxonomy">Jasminum grandiflorum </i>) was originally from West Asia and Indian subcontinent, and is now naturalized in the Iberian peninsula.</p>

	<p> <i class="taxonomy">Jasminum fluminense</i> (which is sometimes known by the inaccurate name "Brazilian Jasmine") and Jasminum dichotomum (Gold Coast Jasmine) are invasive species in Hawaii and Florida. <i class="taxonomy">Jasminum polyanthum</i>, also known as White Jasmine, is an invasive weed in Australia.</p>
